           <p>The collage above shows two projects I have been working on this year. The leftmost 
           	<br>	
           one is a climbing wall that I have been building, and just completed recently. The right
           	<br>
           picture is a picture of a climbing route that I have been projecting for quite some time, 
           	<br>
       		and finally acheived the other day.</p>
